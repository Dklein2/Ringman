Make Purple rings take away points. (added, but need to fix a bug this causes)
Highscores: make the current score a different color.
Limit on bullets.

HowTo: In the act2 page there is a spelling error (FIXED)
audio doesnt stop if the player looses by purple rings (FIXED)

(new) when score is less than 50 in act 2 ,from hitting purple rings the game will revert
to act 1 mode.
